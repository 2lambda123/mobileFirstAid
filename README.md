An app that provides first aid instructions on-the-go.
First aid refers to the emergency or immediate care you 
should provide when a person is injured or ill until 
full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, 
first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first 
aid care should be continued until more advanced care 
becomes available. Putting into consideration the sustainable 
development goals to transform our world this app serves as a means 
to provide good health care and improve well being by providing 
basic first aid instructions for some accident and emergencies 
in a simplified manner that is easy to understand even in an 
hyper-active state of mind. This will go a long way to 
substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses

# Vision
To make this app accessible to all and sundry 
including but not limited to semi-literate individuals, 
in which poor network coverage will not in any way be an 
hinderance to delivering first aid instructions to end users
