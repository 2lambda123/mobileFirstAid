                <p class="instruction">Initial symptoms of caustic soda ingestion include drooling and dysphagia. In severe cases, pain, vomiting, and sometimes bleeding develop immediately in the mouth, throat, chest, or abdomen. Airway burns may cause coughing, tachypnea, or stridor.</p>
                <p>Later symptms of Caustic soda ingestions include stenosis, It occurs after more severe muscocal injury commonly.</p>

              <h2 class="def-heading">Treatments</h2>
              <p class="def">In patients with caustic ingestion, airway monitoring and control is the first priority. When airway compromise is present, a definitive airway must be established. In patients with a stable airway and no clinical or radiological sign of perforation, medical therapy should be initiated.

                Arrangements should be made for urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to grade the degree of injury and establish long-term prognosis, In asymptomatic patients, however, EGD may be withheld in favor of observation. Pediatric patients who remain asymptomatic for several hours (2 - 4 hours) after an exploratory ingestion and who are tolerating a normal diet may be discharged with appropriate follow-up and return precautions
