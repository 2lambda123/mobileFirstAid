                <h3>CHOCKING</h3>
                <p>
                    Choking occurs when a foreign object lodges in the throat or windpipe, 
                    blocking the flow of air. In adults, a piece of food often is the 
                    culprit most of the time. Young children often swallow small objects. 
                    Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, administer first 
                    aid as quickly as possible. The universal sign for choking is hands 
                    clutched to the throat. If the person doesn't give the signal, 
                    look for these indications such as Inability to talk, Difficulty 
                    in breathing or noisy breathing, Squeaky sounds when trying to breathe, 
                    Cough, which may either be weak or forceful, Skin, lips and nails 
                    turning blue or dusky, Skin that is flushed, then turns pale 
                    or bluish in color, Loss of consciousness

                            them to calm and continue coughing freely, it may be 
                            easier to take air through the nose to breathe in and 
                            refill the lungs.
