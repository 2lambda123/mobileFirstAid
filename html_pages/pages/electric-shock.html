                    <h3>ELECTRIC SHOCK</h3>
                    <p>
                        The danger from an electrical shock depends on the type of current, how high the voltage is, how the current traveled through the body, the person's overall health and how quickly the person is treated. An electrical shock may cause burns, or it may leave
                        no visible mark on the skin. In either case, an electrical current passing through the body can cause internal damage, cardiac arrest or other injury. Under certain circumstances, even a small amount of electricity can be fatal.
